So to keep asking the person for an input (or to get input from the file), we will have to use a for loop or a while(True) loop.
WE WILL USE while loop because it is easier to learn.
Here are two examples. Say we are asking for a first and last name. 
We will then split them (the person will of course put a space between first and last names). If they type done, it breaks.

while(True):
	x=input('What is your name? ')
	if x=='done':
	    break
	names=x.split()
	first, last=names
	print('First name is %s'%first)
	print('Last name is %s'%last)

Basically that while(True) just makes it run forever until they enter done or the end of the file. 
The for loop version seen in some of the example answers will just not work the way we have this set.

To avoid issues WE MUST USE THIS LOOP SO THEY CAN USE FILES TO RUN THE PROGRAM.
